- What are your initial impressions of how `Inheritance` affects your programming?

Inheritance simplifies/streamlines things quite a bit! I thought it really saved a lot of time when making each Class! I also thought it really helps you visualize how related classes are similar and different from each other, and you have the hierarchies too, such as if a Class doesn't have its own toString it'll use its parent's! I think that is really usuful and interesting and could lead to applications to create really efficent programs with less time and space/memory.

- What worked, what didn't, what advice would you give someone taking this course in the future?

I think overall the extending and overall properties of each child worked relatively well! Hashtables take a bit to understand, but the javadoc documentation does help quite a bit, by seeing what exactly you can do with them! (ex: seeing what get and replace do specifically for a hashtable can help you figure out what values are going in and out)

For what didn't work, I would say there is still some exception catching to do/write, at least/for example for the process of checking out books or removing titles. While I think I understand most of the basics of Hashtables, trying to write exceptions for them has been tricky, so I am going to keep working on that. 

My future advice is to take it one step at a time! Work through each process and do plenty of tests to make sure these Classes function as you want.
